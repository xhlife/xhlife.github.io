[00:02.10]Love Story
[00:04.10]Taylor Swift
[00:06.10]
[00:16.68]We were both young when I first saw you.
[00:20.37]I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
[00:24.04]I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
[00:30.45]
[00:32.73]See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
[00:36.98]See you make your way through the crowd
[00:40.10]and say hello;
[00:41.96]
[00:43.85]Little did I know
[00:48.58]That you were Romeo; you were throwing pebbles,
[00:52.80]And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
[00:56.61]And I was crying on the staircase,
[00:59.33]begging you, 'Please, don't go.'
[01:03.49]And I said,
[01:05.11]"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
[01:09.37]I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
[01:12.89]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[01:17.46]It's a love story baby just say 'Yes.'
[01:21.75]
[01:25.01]So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
[01:29.19]We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
[01:33.02]So close your eyes; escape this town for a little while.
[01:41.04]'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
[01:44.74]And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet,"
[01:48.97]But you were everything to me; I was begging you, 'Please, don't go,'
[01:55.97]And I said,
[01:57.72]"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
[02:01.80]I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
[02:05.81]You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[02:09.89]It's a love story  baby just say 'Yes.'
[02:13.75]Romeo save me; they're tryin' to tell me how to feel.
[02:17.93]This love is difficult, but it's real.
[02:22.14]Don't be afraid; we'll make it out of this mess.
[02:25.57]It's a love story  baby just say 'Yes.'
[02:30.02]
[02:44.69]I got tired of waiting,
[02:48.73]Wondering if you were ever comin' around.
[02:52.67]My faith in you was fading
[02:57.54]When I met you on the outskirts of town.
[03:01.14]And I said,
[03:01.85]"Romeo save me  I've been feeling so alone.
[03:06.44]I keep waiting for you but you never come.
[03:10.47]Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
[03:14.57]He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,
[03:18.51]"Marry me, Juliet. you'll never have to be alone.
[03:22.62]I love you and that's all I really know.
[03:26.62]I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress;
[03:30.67]It's a love story baby just say 'Yes.'
[03:36.75]
[03:38.23]Oh, oh.
[03:44.59]
[03:46.83]We were both young when I first saw you
[03:52.11]
